I wasn't going to let a soul suffer through computer packages in this day and age. The first few institutions off the top of my head were fairly pricey coding bootcamps that wouldn't work for someone who wanted to test the waters and not necessarily find employment immediately after. I also couldn't go to my default YouTube University since I was dealing with someone who wanted something more structured for their child, preferably onsite in Nairobi and a certificate at the end of it.

I made my way to Google like the netizen I am and came across a few, problem was I had never heard of some of them. I figured I could go ask the people on my phone and got way more than I anticipated. Thus began the rabbit hole that ended up with me compiling this crowdsourced list of schools and programs in no particular order.
